## Prompt

Hackathon II
The Evolution of Todo – Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI
... (The full user prompt text would go here, omitting for brevity in this thought but I will paste it in the real file)

## Response snapshot

Acknowledged the Hackathon requirements. Initialized the project with a task list, implementation plan, and populated the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with core SDA principles. Planning to proceed with Phase I (CLI Todo App).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project structure established and SDD rules defined.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: task.md, implementation_plan.md, constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase I specification and implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: Starting with a strong constitution ensures project consistency across all phases.
